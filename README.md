# Directory Tree (dirtr)

Shows a tree of directories.

Notes about the current status of the project:
- Currently, it is possible to navigate throughout the stored paths in a tree
- Navigation feels clunky, because it wasn't designed for the current row-like display

To-do list:
- [x] Implement tree structure for storing path directories
- [x] Implement tree navigation
- [ ] Implement going into the currently selected path
- [ ] Add graphics for tree representation
