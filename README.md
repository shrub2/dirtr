# file-tree

Shows a tree of directories.

Notes about the current status of the project:
- Currently, it is possible to navigate throughout the stored paths in a tree
- It only shows the current path we navigated to, which is pretty confusing to know where else we can go

To-do list:
- [x] Implement tree structure for storing path directories
- [x] Implement tree navigation
- [ ] Implement going into the currently selected path (like with `cd`)
- [ ] Add graphics for tree representation
